    <p>I like coding because it lets me solve real problems in ways that are both creative and practical. As a web developer at the Marsico Institute, I’ve worked on improving websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve also handled back-end tasks with PHP and SQL to keep things running smoothly. I’ve enjoyed collaborating with other developers to fix bugs, test features, and make sure everything works well for users. I also like working with data—whether it’s building a real estate prediction model in Python or using GIS to study hurricane impacts. I find it rewarding to take raw data, make sense of it, and turn it into something useful. For me, coding is a way to build, explore, and create things that make a difference.</p>
